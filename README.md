<p>
  
Hey 👋, I am **Ethan**, a Ph.D candidate in [DaSE@ECNU](http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) and a member of [dase955](https://github.com/dase955). I am currently learning databases and will delve into modern issues related to databases (e.g., **AI4DB**). Before I met databases, my main research interest was **real-time spatio-temporal data management**. I also worked as a Data Dev intern in Taobao and a Research intern in Alibaba Cloud, respectively. ✨
